BALLOON DODGE 2.0

HOW TO PLAY: In Balloon Dodge 2.0, balloons are STILL raining down from the sky, but that's not all. Mines are also raining
down, and while smaller, they move faster than the red balloons. Make sure not to touch either, or you'll lose a life!
Coins will also fall, and remain on the bottom of the screen when they hit instead of disappearing like the others. Pick
up as many coins as you can, as they'll help you buy things in the local town. The longer you stay alive in dodge mode, the
more points you'll get.

To get to the town, press "v" at any time. You can move freely in the town and click on any of the other colored rectangles
(NPCs) to talk to them. With enough coins you can buy extra lives, bombs that clear the balloons from dodge mode, and 
modifiers that make coins more frequent and mines less so. There is also a mayor and the friendly dog to say hi to.

Lose all 3 lives and it's game over!
